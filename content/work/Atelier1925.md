**Brief** <br>
1925 atelier website was designed to present atelier and sell artdeco products.<br>

**My role** <br>
Working individually to evaluate usability of the site.<br>

**Actions**<br>
First step was to get to know the company, it’s goals, owners vision and expectations, also purchasing process in the company was crucial.
 Google Analytics reports evaluation gave me little information about today web usage according to low visibility of the page.
I’ve conducted an expert analyse of the appearance, information architecture, functionality and navigation.
Rough SEO analyse.

**Main identified issues**<br>
Unclear page purpose.<br> 
Main page consisted of art deco furniture pictures and inspirational articles. At first impression visitor didn’t get an information about page purpose, it was not clear that the company produces and sell art deco products.<br>
Sections names were misleading.<br>
Purchasing process was not defined. Product prices were revealed after mail request.<br>

Page also demanded navigation improvements, especially on mobile version due to hover over functionality.<br>

Not defined keywords, unused in page titles.<br>
To long page load time.<br>

<br>
**Solutions**<br>
The visual message of a great furniture produced by the 1925 studio was strengthened by the title and tagline with clear message. <br>
Navigation was improved: simple menu with clear sections name and good division of the content, resulted in better user journey. Also unused VIP area was deleted and functionality of recommendation was introduced.<br>
Recommendation of a keyword oriented tekst definition.<br>
