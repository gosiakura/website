BRIEF:
Droneradar mobile application was designed to help pilots fly Unmanned Aerial Vehicles safely.
Flying, even recreational drones, should be conducted according to aviation rules. 
There are two main objectives for an app and system:
to advise the pilot about the airspace regulations and current conditions
to inform other users and flight controllers about the flight

MY ROLE:
Working individually to evaluate and redesign the mobile application. 
Introduce new functionality, ie. prediction about airspace availability in the the future (inclusion time factor into flight prediction).
