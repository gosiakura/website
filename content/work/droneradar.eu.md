**Brief** <br>
Droneradar is an aeronautical software company that creates UTM solution.<br>
Next to mobile application for drone pilots, API for partners was developed. During company development authorities become important business partners of the service.<br>

**My role** <br>
Working with stakeholders to define consistent company web page.<br>

**Actions**<br>
Interview with stakeholders to understand solutions, business goals and development of the company.<br>
Competition analyse. <br> 

**Issues**<br>
Different layout and design styles of the page subsections.<br>
That resulted also in unconsistent navigation patterns: haburger menus, navigation menu on top or on a side.<br>
Long text often difficult to read was defined. <br>

**Solutions**
Architecture of the site was developed to clearly support three main branches defined by the company owners. <br>
Data was structured so to give information about the branch and present CTA immediately when customer is ready.  <br>

New graphic design will be presented soon.
